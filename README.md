# Noe's build of dwmblocks

My build of dwmblocks is pretty much standard, except for the scripts I used, which of course, came from [Luke Smith](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/tree/master/.local/bin/statusbar). I only made some small, personal modifications, such as [removing newlines from command output](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/dwmblocks/pull/12/commits/6bbd6545f422bab6dfd341d88e99316f4cdab7ac) and adding [bar padding](https://github.com/flipMWD/dwmblocks/commit/82efdb743e207df9c74d8123bcc2e8502ce97786).

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/thatguynoe/dwmblocks
cd dwmblocks
sudo make install
```
